    Feedback: Absolutely! 
   Thanks to: Aegis, Techie, Major Tom and Maverick for their help and feedback while testing these maps.


I decided to convert some existing maps into G66 MPI maps because noone else was making any new G66 maps.  Natty gave us this great G66 engine and some nice maps in hopes that others would step in and make more.  I have only seen one other G66 map besides what Natty released.  Wanting to play more G66 maps I stepped up to the plate and took a swing at it.

Here is my attempt at providing more G66 MPI maps for us to play.  These maps have been tested pretty darn well, but there is always the chance that we missed something.  Please let me know if you find any problems or have comments.  Thanks for taking the time to download these maps and I hope you enjoy them!

REQUIREMENTS:

	Battlezone II Combat Commander
	BZII 1.2 Official Beta Patch
	G66 Version 1.3 -- MOD by Natty Bumpo
	(Recommended that you get G66 Version 1.4 or higher to solve the lag issues due to unit over-production
	present in versions 1.3 and earlier.)

	Visit:  http://www.planetbattlezone.com/maproom to get anything you are missing from the above list.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

	To INSTALL simply unzip each map pak zip file into your "\program files\battlzone 2\" folder.
	The zip will create new folders for each map and put the map files in these new folders automatically.
	You will find everything under the following folder:

	"\program files\battlzone 2\addon\missions\multiplayer\Centerline\"



REMOVAL INSTRUCTIONS:

	To UNINSTALL my map paks do one of two things:

	1.  Delete the entire folder "\program files\battlzone 2\addon\missions\multiplayer\Centerline\"
	2.  Or, delete the individual map folder that you don't want anymore.

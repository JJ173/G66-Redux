This map is designed for the G66 Mod version 1.5 for Battlezone II version 1.2

This may may not be modified, changed, updated, upgraded, edited or reworked in any way, without written permission directly from the BETA team. Failure to accept these terms means you should not use this map.

Hats off to the BETA team. They consist of FRYIN_PAN, Den, Major_Tom , Tankdealer and Citabria.

This map was created in early 2004 by The BETA Team. We wandered off of BZII to play a few other games in 2005-2007. We realized that we had a coffer full of maps that were unreleased, most of them almost Gold.

We will be releasing these maps throughout the year. We hope to release approximately 8-10 maps in the near future.

The BETA Team maps are NOT for the faint of heart. Our maps are some of the most challenging maps out for BZII, hands down. So if you like solid challenge during setup:

On the G66 main setup page, set everything to HARD and choose scrap boost at the bottom to NORMAL. Then start the game and hold on !

The only official downloading site for these neew maps in 2008 will be from:

http://www.bz-majortom.com

Look for the "QUICKLINK" button on the top of the navigation buttons. It also gives a brief description, picture and download link in the G66 button as well. Any other map that houses these maps may be questionable in nature. We recommend downloading it from the original source.

As with all of our maps, we test them quite extensively. Should you find any MAJOR bugs or issues, feel free to contact us at: majortomn@techie.com

Enjoy !

The BETA Team

     ***Drought G66v2***
***Mission description***   The enemy has seized control of & is recklessly draining this once fertile planet dry of Bio-Metal & also whats left of its precious Water supply. This missions success is imperative as this planet is an important link in our supply route & for the vital strategic advantage its location affords. Most importantly we must arrest & attempt to reverse the destruction of this now delicate eco-system.
***Mission objectives***    Search for the mysterious automated factory portals created by a rebel EDF/Scion alliance. Utilize the forgotten yet powerful hybrid vehicles the portals still produce as they may be essential assets in the battle to defeat this evil threat.

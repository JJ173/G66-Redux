// Translation: a way to pick a MOD before a game, and have it not
// cause bad assets, assuming the author wrote it well.
//
// Format of lines: odf filename, space separator, description.
// Lines starting with // are ignored.
//
// NOTE: do not put .odf extension on odf filename; added automatically
// on loading
//
// Also, please remember that these vehicle names will be changed to
// the appropriate race at runtime, so make sure they exist across
// races -- for example, ivmbike has no Scion counterpart (fvmbike).
//
// The first field on each line must be 5 characters or longer, or the
// line will be ignored.

These gun ODFs are included for use with the Scion Attendant, using a special factory weapon list ODF to allow configuration of this tank without adding these weapons to the armory, as they are rather redundant on their own.

In short: these are the exact same ISDF guns and pilot weapons, but they are designed for use with the attendant configuration menu.

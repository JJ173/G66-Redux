"Route 66" Custom MPI Configuration


Overview
--------

    GAIPS66 "Route 66" MPI map conversion is relatively simple and quickly done
    for existing maps.  Little or no terrain modification is necessary, unless
    steep slopes need to be smoothed or new passages cut to allow computer team
    vehicles to run along attack paths more smoothly.  Test the map to make sure
    no steep slopes block attacking vehicles.

    The conversion process primarily requires the placement of a single player
    spawn point and the placement of several path points, which will be used to
    place buildings and units and direct the computer team's movements.  Some of
    the path points are required for the proper function of the AIP and DLL.
    Others are optional and may be placed at the descretion of the map maker to
    suit the needs of the mission.

    It is generally a good idea to place the computer team at the north end of 
    the map.  Computer team buildings will always be oriented to face south.
    If the computer team is placed at the other sides of the map, vehicles 
    emerging from production units could be blocked, resulting in AI freeze.

    Since the structure of the AIP files is more closely tied to the performance
    of the DLL than was true for the stock DLL, extreme caution should be taken,
    if modifications to the AIP are attempted.  A single mistake in an AIP file
    could seriously compromise the performance of the DLL.

Required Map Objects
--------------------

  - pspwn_1
    The only required map object for GAIPS66 is the player spawn point.  
    This object should be set for team 0 and placed in the human team 
    base building area near the Recycler path point.


Required Path Points
--------------------

    All path point names are case-sensitive.  They must be spelled exactly
    as shown here; otherwise, the game may crash or certain objects will 
    not be built as expected.

  - Recycler
    The Recycler path point determines the area where the human team 
    recycler will be located.  This should be placed in or near the 
    intended human team base building area.

  - RecyclerEnemy
    The RecyclerEnemy path point determines where the computer team
    recycler will be located.  The recycler will be deployed very near 
    this point, so the path point should be located with care.

  - pgen1
    If the CPU is ISDF, the first power generator will be built here.

  - dropoff_recy_6
    The CPU recycler dropoff point.  Units produced by the computer 
    team recycler will move to this point as soon as they exit the 
    recycler.

  - kiln
    This is where the computer team Kiln will be placed, if the CPU 
    race is set to Scion.  Note this point can be set in a different 
    location from the ISDF Factory.

  - factory
    This is where the computer team Factory will be placed, if the 
    CPU race is set to ISDF.

  - dropoff_fact_6
    The CPU factory dropoff point.  Units produced by the computer 
    team factory will move to this point as soon as they exit the 
    factory.

  - holdserv
    The holdserv path point is meant for the location of service units 
    intended for computer team maintenance.  This path point should be 
    located near the RecyclerEnemy path point.

  - cbun1, gtow1, gtow1b, gtow1c
    The cbun1, gtow1, gtow1b, and gtow1c path points must be placed near each other 
    and aligned with the map grid.  Failure to place these points properly 
    may prevent the computer team constructor building the corresponding 
    command bunker and gun towers.  This could result in "AI Freeze".    
    These path points should be placed in or near the computer team base area.

  - cbun2, gtow2, gtow2b
    The cbun2, gtow2 and gtow2b path points must be placed near each other 
    and aligned with the map grid.  Failure to place these points properly 
    may prevent the computer team constructor building the corresponding 
    command bunker and gun towers.  This could result in "AI Freeze".    
    These path points should be placed in or near the computer team base area.

  - cbun3, gtow3, cbun4, gtow4, cbun5, gtow5, cbun6, gtow6
    The remaining cbun# and gtow# path points must be placed near each other 
    and aligned with the map grid.  Failure to place these points properly 
    may prevent the computer team constructor building the corresponding 
    command bunker and gun towers.  This could result in "AI Freeze".    

  - gspir1, gspir1b, gspir2, gspir2b, gspir3 - 6
    If the computer team is Scion, gun spires will be placed at these path points.

  - rspir1 - 4
    If the computer team is Scion, rocket spires will be placed at these points.

  - rtow1 - 4
    If the computer team is ISDF, rocket towers will be placed at these points. 
    Make sure these points are contiguous with the corresponding command bunkers.

  - hold1 - 4
    These are the standard hold points referenced by AIP file Hold plans.
    The hold path points may be placed anywhere; locations near critical 
    scrap pools or choke points are good places for hold points.  

  - stage1 - 32
    These are the standard stage points used by AIP Attacker plans to stage
    attacking vehicles on their way to human team targets.  The stage path 
    points are best located near enough to the human team base to avoid 
    allowing the vehicles of an attack group getting separated between the
    stage point and the target.  Care should be taken to position the stage
    path points so the attacking vehicles have an unobstructed path to their
    targets.

  - trthold1 - 3
    The holdTRT path points should be placed within the computer team base
    area in the line that would be followed by the human team ISDF bomber.  
    If the computer team is ISDF, TRT's will be positioned at these path points 
    to defend against aircraft attacks, the bomber in particular.

  - artlef1 - 3
    The artlef path points should be placed on an elevated area near the 
    computer team base in the line that would be followed by the human team
    ISDF bomber.  If the computer team is ISDF, specially modified Archers
    will be placed at these path points to defend against aircraft attacks,
    the bomber in particular.
    (Not currently used because of known problem with Hold plans.)

  - artlgas1 - 2  ** NOT CURRENTLY USED **
    The artlgas path points should be placed on an elevated area near the 
    human team base within mortar range.  During the latter stages of a game
    session, if the computer team is Scion, Archers will be positioned at these
    path points to provide opportunity attacks against human team units.
    (Not currently used because of known problem with Hold plans, but place
    the points anyway; they will likely be put to use again later.)

  - attack1 - 9
    The attack paths are sets of connected path points that provide running 
    paths for attacking squads dispatched by the G66 DLL.  These paths may
    be run along virtually any course; however, care should be taken to avoid 
    steep slopes, deep water and other obstructions.  It is best to place the
    starting path point near or within the computer team base and place the 
    ending path point within the human team base.

  - mbtattack1 - 9
    The mbtattack paths are sets of connected path points that provide running
    paths for attacking hovercraft dispatched by the G66 DLL.  Since only hovercraft
    will be dispatched on this path, it may run over terrain that might not be 
    accessible to non-hovercraft vehicles.  Water for example is not an obstacle.
    It is best to place the starting path point near or within the computer team
    base and place the ending path point within the human team base.  The old
    mbtattack path is still valid and will be used if no number mbtattack# paths
    are found.

  - patrol1 - 9
    The patrol paths are sets of connected path points whose starting and ending
    points are near to one another to form a closed loop.  Units dispatched by the 
    G66 DLL onto these paths will patrol continuously from beginning to end over 
    and over.  The G66 MPI DLL will periodically switch patrolling units from one
    path to another, or send them to attack extractors.

  - build1 - 2
    Extra units built by the G66 DLL are inserted into the map at the build path
    points.  Assault group leaders are created at build1 and support units are
    created at build2.  These path points should be placed within or behind the
    computer team base area.

  - asmbl1
    Newly created assault group leaders, whether built by the G66 DLL or the AIP
    files, are dispatched to the assembly path point.  There they will wait until 
    support units are built for them.  When the complete assault group is ready, the
    G66 DLL will dispatch them to an attack path.  The assembly point is best placed
    within or behind the computer team base area.


Optional Path Points
--------------------

    All path point names are case-sensitive.  They must be spelled exactly
    as shown here; otherwise, these objects will not be built as expected.

  - edge_path
    If you want to keep the human team away from the physical edges of the map, 
    or if the play area of the map is smaller than the physical size, you should 
    include the edge_path.  This can be a simple diagonal line across the map.  
    Set one end at any corner and the other at the diagonally opposite corner.  
    The players will not be able to move outside the area defined by the dimensions 
    of the edge_path.

  - turretEnemy1 - 9
    A single computer team turret will be placed at each of these path points.
    These can be placed anywhere on the map, though the computer team base
    area, scrap pools and choke points are among the best places to put them.
    Be aware that the DLL will place turrets near randomized scrap pools, so 
    there is no need to place these turrets near them.  Place turretEnemy# 
    path points near fixed scrap pools instead.

  - SentryEnemy1 - 3
    A single computer team Sentry or Missile Scout will be placed at each of
    these path points.  These can be placed anywhere on the map.  At startup,
    these vehicles will be dispatched to patrol paths.  At the computer team
    reinforcement interval, new vehicles will be placed at these points, if
    the previously placed vehicle has been destroyed.

  - RcktTwr1 - 6
    A single Rocket Tower or Rocket Spire will be placed at each of these path
    points for the computer team.  These can be placed on any flat surface on 
    the map.  These units will not be replaced when destroyed.  Each of these
    points is optional.  RcktTwr1 and 2 will be placed at the Easy difficulty
    level, RcktTwr3 and 4 on Normal, and RcktTwr5 and 6 on Hard.

  - ubergun1 - 6
    A custom Assault Tower or Snake Tower will be placed at each of these points,
    if present, depending on the difficulty level.  These units are placed at the
    game start and are not replaced when destroyed.  Each of these points is
    optional.  ubergun1 and 2 will be placed at the Normal difficulty level,
    ubergun3 and 4 on Hard, and ubergun5 and 6 on Insane.

  - PwrGen1 - 2
    A Power Generator is required for every three Rocket Towers.  Failure to 
    provide the proper number of Power Generators to accomodate the Rocket
    Towers will prevent the computer team building its base.  If you place 
    three or fewer Rocket Tower path points, place at least one Power Generator
    path point as well.  For more than three Rocket Tower path points, place
    both Power Generator path points.  These path points may be placed on any 
    flat surface on the map.  Destroyed Power Generators will be replaced, 
    though they will not likely appear at the original points since their
    construction will be directed by the AIP files.
    (Upgraded power generators are placed on these points for extra power.)

  - Turret1 - 3
    A single Human team turret will be placed at each of these path points at
    startup and placed under the commander's control.  At the human team 
    reinforcement interval, another turret will appear at each of these points.

  - Scout1 - 3
    A single Human team scout will be placed at each of these path points at
    startup and placed under the commander's control.  At the human team 
    reinforcement interval, another scout will appear at each of these points.

  - Tank1 - 3
    A single Human team tank will be placed at each of these path points at
    startup and placed under the commander's control.  At the human team 
    reinforcement interval, another tank will appear at each of these points.

  - FuryTank1 - 6
    A single computer team Fury Tank will be placed at each of these path 
    points at startup.  Place a patrol path, not a single path point.  The 
    Fury tanks will be set to patrol.

  - laserpod1a/b - 6a/b
    Place laserpod paths in a/b pairs.  You can leave one or the other of the 
    pair, if you don't need both of them.  Place a patrol path, not a single 
    path points.  The Laserpods will be set to patrol.  Laserpods should be 
    placed near the corresponding FuryTank point as the laserpods will first 
    appear at the FuryTank point and move to the laserpod paths.

  - surprise1 - 9
    Groups of tanks, interceptors, or Maulers will appear at these points at
    random intervals and will be sent to attack base buildings.  These path points
    are optional.  The path point surprise1 is also used for special purposes, such 
    as providing emergency reinforcements for the computer team during a siege. 
    This path point should be placed behind the computer team base.

  - scrfield1 - 16
    A random number of loose scrap buttons will be place near these points.
    These path points are optional.

  - scrpool1a, 1b, 1c - 9a, 9b, 9c
    These path points allow variable placement of scrap pools.  If more than one
    point in a set of three is present, the placement of the scrap pool for the set
    will be selected at random.  A small number of scrap buttons will be placed at
    the other path points.  These path points are optional.  Scrap pools can be 
    set to fixed positions in the map editor instead.

  - minefld1 - 9
    A random number of mines will be placed at these points, if the Mine Fields
    configuration option is On.  If the computer team is Scion, a small number of 
    zap mines will be placed.  Otherwise, a larger number of proximity mines will
    be placed near these points.  These path points are optional.

  - jakherd1 - 9
    A random number of Killer Jaks will be placed near these points.  These path
    points are optional.

  - rhinoherd1 - 9
    A random number of Ice Rhinos will be placed near these points.  These path
    points are optional.
    
  - jammer1-9
    If the CPU team is Scion, a jammer will be placed at each of these points.

  - power1-4
    If the crate drops option is on, weapon power-ups will be placed at these 
    points at pre-set intervals during the game.

  - geyser1 - 9
    If earthquakes are active on the map, geysers will be placed at these points 
    when an earthquake occurs.

  - volcano1 - 9
    If earthquakes are active on the map, volcanic fountains will be placed at 
    these points when an earthquake occurs.

  - lavabl1 - 9  *** TEMPORARILY DISABLED, waiting for sound bug fix ***
    If earthquakes are active on the map, boiling lava fountains will be placed at 
    these points when an earthquake occurs.

  - smoker1 - 9
    If earthquakes are active on the map, smoking geysers will be placed at 
    these points when an earthquake occurs.

  - rspX#_nnn_odf1_odf2
    Optional extra unit respawn points, where "X" is "C" for the CPU team, "h" for
    the human team, or "n" for neutral, "nnn" is the respawn interval in seconds 
    (any number of digits), "odf1" is the ODF name for the unit to be built if the
    team is ISDF, and "odf2" is the ODF name for the unit to be built if the team
    is Scion.  "odf2" is optional and if not present, "odf1" will be built regardless
    of team race.  Replace "#" with a number to make each respawn path point name
    unique.  ***NOTE: neutral vehicle pilots are killed to remove them, and players
    are notified about it in the on-screen message area.  If you find that too 
    annoying, use a respawn object on your map instead to place empty vehicles.
